# Introduction

You find a strange mirror that always shows a hand that is moving. 
The hand appears to be alive, and after a lot of questions of "yes" and "no" answer, you know that the hand is trying to teach you a program that is written in HPL (Hand Programming Language).

This language works with a memory of an indefinite size of bytes, with all values initialized to 0.
This language haves 7 instructions:

ğŸ‘‰ : moves the memory pointer to the next cell

ğŸ‘ˆ : moves the memory pointer to the previous cell

ğŸ‘† : increment the memory cell at the current position 

ğŸ‘‡ : decreases the memory cell at the current position. 

ğŸ¤œ : if the memory cell at the current position is 0, jump just after the corresponding ğŸ¤›

ğŸ¤› : if the memory cell at the current position is not 0, jump just after the corresponding ğŸ¤œ

ğŸ‘Š : Display the current character represented by the ASCII code defined by the current position.

## Notes:
- As memory cells are bytes, from 0 to 255 value, if you decrease 0 you'll get  255, if you increment 255 you'll get 0.
- Loops of ğŸ¤œ and ğŸ¤› can be nested. 

# Tests
The hand shows you two small programs and their outputs:

## This program display "Hello"

## This program (with nested loops) display "Hello World!"

# Challenge
The file "input.hand" is the code of the program


Good luck!


# Solution by RSV
1. mkdir hand-challenge
2. cd hand-challenge
3. npm init
4. npm install -save-dev jest (Other option is -D instead of -save-dev) --> Jest is used to test the project
5. Add script section in package.json: "scripts": { "test": "jest" }
6. Create mySolution.js, test.js, test1.hand, test2.hand and index*.js
6. npm run test --> Test
7. node "index.js" --> Program using test1.hand and test2.hand
